# ion-less-affix

This is a fork of [ion-affix](https://github.com/jonaszuberbuehler/ion-affix) the orginial README.md can be found at OLD-README.md.
This fork is an attempt to remove the ionic required elements and replace them with generic HTML Elements. Allowing more flexibily where the CSS property/value `position: sticky` may not be avaliable to use.

##### Note:
This should not be used if `position: sticky` is avaliable in your desisred build/run enviroment, and should be used when device's do not support sticky or a portion of required devices do not.
